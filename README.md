<br/>

## Description
A text based game in which multiple players compete for global
domination in a text-based world. Includes local multiplayer.
Unfortunately, development on this project has ended, despite
unresolved problems in the project's code. Each version is
described below:

1. `Main.java`  
    This is an old version, which appears to work. It appears
    to be the newest stable version.
2. `OldMain.java`  
    This is an old version, which appears to work.
3. `DevelopmentMain.java`  
    This version was in development, and has many errors 
    that prevent its function. It also has naming conflicts
    with Main.java, who will most likely take priority.

You can also find some codes for example games in ShortCodes.txt.
Please note these codes were used during development and are mostly
randomly made groups and not meant to be historically accurate or
high quality.

Under `Images`, you can find two files, `Continents.png` shows a
map with all of the game's continents, and `Water Routes.png` shows
a map of which countries are connected by water routes,
